I'm Ian Yang, software engineer at [Intridea](http://www.intridea.com). I also
worked for [iZENEsoft](http://www.izenesoft.com) and
[Augmentum](http://www.augmentum.com) before.

I have over four years of experience developing high-performance, server-side
applications in C++. I has the technical expertise in field advertising,
information retrieval, machine learning and data mining.

I work at home after joining Intridea in 2011. Since then I focus on web
application development, mainly using Ruby on Rails.

In the most time, I live in Jiangsu. And sometimes I'll travel to other cities.
